## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS / Bootstrap
- Mobile-first workflow

This is a very tiny project to use bootstrap for. Since the task is very simple, I toyed with light/dark theme switching.

### Continued Development

This is a good snippet that may fit well in a larger project. I may revisit this to re assess if my choice of colors for the theme switch are optimal.
